## ⚠️ Problem
Phone scams are a growing threat worldwide, causing people to lose money and sensitive personal data every day.  
Existing protections like call blocking or spam filters are limited, since scammers constantly change phone numbers  
and social engineering techniques. Many victims only realize they've been scammed after it’s too late.

## 💡 Solution
ProtecTalk is a mobile app that helps users identify potential scam calls after the call ends.  
The service records the call audio, converts it to text, and analyzes it with AI models to detect scam patterns.  
Once the analysis is complete, the system alerts both the user and a trusted contact configured in advance.  
This provides timely and reliable feedback that helps protect people from fraudulent activity.
